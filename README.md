# Global-Weather-App
  A full-stack weather web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The application utilizes data from a weather API found on openweathermap.org.

Front-end: 

Made a seamless user interface with HTML and CSS through numerous iterations of features such as spacing, device compatibility and background images.

Back-end: 

Fetched weather data from openweathermap.org and converted the units to Celsius. 

Designed an error message when city is entered incorrectly. 

Ensured variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and description changed timely according to the city typed in. 

As a plus, background images show up to fit the current weather of the city typed in, and once the web application starts up, Dallas is the default weather (of course).
